## Next.js E-Commerce Project

Created by Jakub Oksa for UpLeveled FullStack Bootcamp.
Work in Progress, as my focus currently shifts on the final project.

### Description

This is a simple e-commerce project created with Next.js, React, and SCSS. It uses a database to fetch products and display them on the page. The user can add products to the cart and remove them from the cart. The cart is saved inside the cookies.

There is no payment information stored anywhere, as it is purely a demo project / doesn't have a payment provider.

### Getting Started

To initialize the repository, run:
pnpm install

To start the localhost, run:
pnpm dev

The application should be available on http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
